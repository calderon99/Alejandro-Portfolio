## Problem Domain
 
A wildfire is a fire occurring in nature that is unplanned and uncontrolled. They are a natural occurrence that bring new life to the ecosystem and carry other surprising benefits to the environment. There are unnatural causes of wildfires, however, most notably from human activity. Whether natural or man-made, wildfires can be dangerous to nearby communities and ecosystems if they grow too large.
 
The prevalence of wildfires in the Western United States seems to be growing each year. Such an observation is common among residents of Washington, including our group members. We will investigate if wildfires are indeed gaining prevalence, and if so, at what rate. Additionally, we intend to explore the trends in the causes and effects of these fires to help educate the public.
 
Presenting the causes and effects of such catastrophic events will heighten public awareness of the issue. This awareness will better prepare citizens to make informed decisions in their interaction with the environment and lawmaking. Understanding causes of wildfires will help prevent them, and learning the consequences of environmental misconduct will deter poor behavior.
 
Our group is interested in this subject because it hits close to home. Most of our group members are residents of the Western United States, a region that has brutal wildfire seasons. The smoke and ash that consumes our cities each summer are a constant reminder of the environmental battles we face. We are curious to know the trends of these wildfires, their causes, and their effects.
 
[The ESRI Disaster Response Program Wildfire Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2ff1677111ae4018ac705fcce7c3312f) is a web application that uses real-time data to map burning wildfires in the United States. Some of our group members used this in recent summers to see where fires were burning in real-time. Such information is useful to plan outdoor events and travel since avoiding areas of high smoke is important for one's health.
 
[The Union of Concerned Scientists recently published a feature detailing US wildfire trends in a series of infographics](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/infographic-wildfires-and-climate-change). The article displays a series of graphs showing wildfire trends and various images of their immense destruction. The article explores the most significant causes and what appropriate action may look like, although it does not go very far in-depth. Our group would like to explore the topic in more detail to see if a more nuanced perspective can be reached through data science.
 
## Analysis Questions
 
- Is the prevalence of wildfires in the United States growing according to common metrics?  [Number of fires, acres burned, property destruction, etc.]
 
- What are the trends among the causes and effects of these wildfires?
 
- What States/Regions are affected the most by these fires?

- Is there a relationship between wildfire proximity to a city and its cause?
 
## Data Sets
 
1. [NOAA Wildfire Frequency and Acres Burned from 2000-2020](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/wildfires/ytd/0)
- The data was provided by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). It was sorted by acres burned and numbers of fire. There's also a row for the ratios of the acres and numbers of fire.
- The analysis question that this data set will possibly answer is whether the prevalence of wildfires in the Western United States is growing according to common metrics? [Number of fires, acres burned, property destruction, etc.]
 
2. [Fire Service USDA Wildfire Locations from ~1950-2018](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-07-wildfire-trends)
- The data was collected from the 1950s throughout 2017. The data was collected by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP)
- This article/evidence will help us answer which areas are most affected by wildfires and which regions have been able to mitigate fires and which have not.
 
 
3. [Stanford US Wildfire Reports from 2014-2017](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/xj043rd8767)
- This data was collected as part of an investigation by Big Local News, a project of the Stanford Journalism and Democracy Initiative, into the costs of wildfires across the U.S.
- This data shows that the cost of suppressing wildfire increased over the past few years in California.
- It also compares to those for other states in the U.S. and can be used to evaluate why California's wildfires are more costly and devastating than the other parts of the U.S.
